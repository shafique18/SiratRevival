# Introduction

## ðŸ“˜ Project Name: **SiratRevival**

**SiratRevival** is a self-sponsored digital initiative aimed at reviving the foundational understanding of Islam for people of all ages and languages. Its core vision is to enable every Muslim to comprehend the message of Islam beyond ritualsâ€”understanding it as a complete system of life that governs social, economic, cultural, legal, and spiritual domains.

In a world where Islamic knowledge is often locked behind language barriers or inaccessible scholarly formats, SiratRevival seeks to leverage modern technologyâ€”particularly AI and LLMsâ€”to break those barriers.

The mission is to unify the Ummah on the foundations of authentic knowledge, presented in native languages through interactive and engaging experiences. From early childhood to elder years, SiratRevival aims to offer tailored learning paths that nurture faith, knowledge, and character based on the Qurâ€™an and Sunnah.
